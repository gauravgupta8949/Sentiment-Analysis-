This model is an LSTM model for Big Mart Sales Prediction.  <br> <br>

Here, we have used the training dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews <br>
Then, manipulated the data, i.e., converted positive to 1 and negative to 0. <br>
Then, we have done Data Pre-Processing. <br>
Then, made and compiled the model for LSTM. <br>
Then, trained the model for the test data and achieved an acuuracy of 82%. <br>

Finally, we have build a predictive function and ran it on a few examples.
